# Web_scraping

My first steps to learn Web Scraping using the Beautiful Soup module for python.

I used the module to scrape my personal portfolio website and search for all the projects listed there.
And finally i used the csv module to dynamically write the projects into the csv file.


### Modules used:
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Requests
3. Csv
